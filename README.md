## Symmetric Encryption Using Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement

  
The aim of this assignment is to perform symmetric encryption using the block cipher AES. Before this encryption can be done, a key must be exchanged with the receiver of the message (me); this will be done using _Diffie-Hellman key agreement_. The values which you need to know for this exchange are as follows:

The _prime modulus_ _p_ is the following 1024-bit prime (given in hexadecimal):

<tt>b59dd795 68817b4b 9f678982 2d22594f 376e6a9a bc024184 6de426e5 dd8f6edd

The _generator_ _g_ is the following (again in hexadecimal):

<tt>44ec9d52 c8f9189e 49cd7c70 253c2eb3 154dd4f0 8467a64a 0267c9de fe4119f2

My public key _A_ for the Diffie-Hellman key change is given by _g<sup>a</sup>_ (mod _p_) where _a_ is my private key. _A_ has the following value:

<tt>5af3e806 e0fa466d c75de601 86760516 792b70fd cd72a5b6 238e6f6b 76ece1f1

In order to perform the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, you should do the following:

1.  Generate a _random_ 1023-bit integer; this will be your _private key_ _b_.
2.  Generate your public key _B_ given by _g<sup>b</sup>_ (mod _p_)
3.  Calculate the shared key _s_ given by _A<sup>b</sup>_ (mod _p_)

Now that you have the value of the shared key _s_, you can use this as the key for your AES encryption. However, this key is too large (1024 bits) to be used directly as the AES key. You should therefore use SHA-256 to produce a 256-bit digest from the shared key _s_, giving a 256-bit AES key _k_.

You will then encrypt an input binary file using AES in CBC mode with the 256-bit key _k_ and a block size of 128-bits. The IV for this encryption (_i_) will be a randomly generated 128-bit value. You will use the following padding scheme (as given in lectures): if the final part of the message is less than the block size, append a 1-bit and fill the rest of the block with 0-bits; if the final part of the message is equal to the block size, then create an extra block starting with a 1-bit and fill the rest of the block with 0-bits.

The implementation language must be Java. You will have to make use of the BigInteger class (java.math.BigInteger), the security libraries (java.security.*) and the crypto libraries (javax.crypto.*). You must not make use of the modular exponentiation method provided by the BigInteger class; all modular exponentiation must be done using one of the two methods described in the lectures. You can however make use of the crypto libraries to perform the AES encryption and the SHA-256 hashing.

Once your implementation is complete, you should create a zip file containing all your code, encrypt this file as described above, and send me the following by email:

*   Your 1024-bit public key _B_ in hexadecimal.
*   Your 128-bit IV (_i_) in hexadecimal.
*   Your zipped code file which was encrypted.
*   Your AES encryption of the above zipped code file in hexadecimal.
*   A declaration that this is solely your own work (except elements that are explicitly attributed to another source).

When I receive your email I will decrypt the AES ciphertext using your public key and IV, which should match the submitted zipped code file for a correct submission.

This assignment is due **10am on Monday 7<sup>th</sup> November.**

*Submissions without the declaration will not be assessed.*

**This assignment carries 15 marks and late submissions will be penalised 1.5 marks for each 24 hours the assignment is overdue.**
